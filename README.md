A [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) node based in [tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) that enables to run custom image classification trained models using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image) tool.

## Install

You have two options to install the node.

- Use `Manage palette` option in `Node-RED` Menu (recommended)
  ![manage_pallete](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37800834/80922178-88923b00-8d7b-11ea-9fcf-ea1839bfee09.png)

- Run the following command in your `Node-RED` user directory - typically `~/.node-red`

  ```bash
  npm install node-red-contrib-teachable-machine
  ```

**Note:** If you run the command you will need to restart `Node-RED` after installation. If installation goes wrong please open a [new issue](https://github.com/bonastreyair/node-red-contrib-teachable-machine/issues).

## Node usage

### Step 1

Go to [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image) and follow the steps to train your custom classification model. Once trained click on the `Export Model` button.

### Step 2

Select `Tensorflow.js` format and upload your trained model (for free). Once it is uploaded, copy the generated URL.

### Step 3

Paste the saved URL into the node configuration. That URL hosts all the information to load your trained model. Make sure you copy all the given URL including the `https://...`.

![config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37800834/80922980-e8d7ab80-8d80-11ea-8c0c-89d1008455da.png)

### Step 4

In `Node-RED` send a buffered image to the node. Check the example in the `Import` section.

## Requirements

- `Node-RED v1.0.0+`

*Note:* MacOSX Catalina, Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04 are supported as well as using official `docker nodered/node-red` [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nodered/node-red/) based on [Alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) image. Works with Raspberry Pi too since release [`v1.2.0+`](https://github.com/bonastreyair/node-red-contrib-teachable-machine/tags).
