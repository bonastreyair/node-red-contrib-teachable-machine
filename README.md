# node-red-contrib-teachable-machine
A Node-RED](https://nodered.org) node based in [tensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) that enables to run custom trained models using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image) tool.

## Install
Use `Manage Palette` option in `Node-RED` Menu or run the following command in your `Node-RED` user directory (typically `~/.node-red`).
```
npm install node-red-contrib-teachable-machine
```

## Node usage
### Step 1
Go to [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image) and follow the steps to train your custom classification model.

### Step 2 
Once trained the model, click on the `Export Model` button and select `Tensorflow.js` format. Then upload your trained model for free and copy the generated URL.

### Step 3
Paste the saved URL into the node. That URL hosts all the information to load your trained model.

### Step 4 
In 1Node-RED1 Send a buffered image to the node.

## Requirements
* `Node-RED v1.0.0+`
* Supported OS: MacOSX Catalina, Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04

**NOTE**: This not is not working using official `docker nodered/node-red` [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nodered/node-red/) since it is based on Alpine and it has an incompatibility found in this [issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/1425).
